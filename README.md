ngFor directive. Each book should be displayed with its title, author, and cover image. The
data for the books can be hardcoded in the component or loaded from an external API.

first assignment. The search should allow users to search for books based on their title or
author. The results of the search should be displayed in real-time as the user types.

Assignment 03: Create a simple form in Angular that allows users to add new books to the
list displayed in the first assignment. The form should have fields for the book's title,
author, and cover image. After the user submits the form, the new book should be added to
the list.
